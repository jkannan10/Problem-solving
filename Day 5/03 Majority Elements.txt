BAYER MOORE VOTING ALGORITHM 

Step 1 : Select the candidate for the majority element by traversing into the array.
Step 2 : Traverse the array when the count is zero  , then make the cuurent element as candidate and whenever the candidate appears increase the cnt else decrese the count.
Step 3 : after selecting the candidate check the occurence of the candidate and it should be greater than n/ 2 else return -1;

class Solution {
    public int majorityElement(int[] nums) {
        int count = 0;
        int candidate = 0;
        
        for (int num : nums) {
            if (count == 0) {
                candidate = num;
                count = 1;
            }
            
            if (num == candidate) {
                count++;
            } else {
                count--;
            }
        }
        
        return candidate;
    }
